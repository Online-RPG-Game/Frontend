# MUD Game Idea Submission: RAC

## Race Against Corona
### Overview

In this MUD game, you wake up in a hospital. You’re informed that you were infected by the Corona virus outbreak but that there’s no one left to take care of you, or the ill patients around you. You’re weak and your breathing is ragged. A doctor (who’s also a patient in your ward) tells you that there was some cure/headway made in the lab. You ask where the lab is, but he dies. 

Your husband, son and grandfather are in the hospital. Time is not on your side. You must make your way to the lab and pray to God a cure is available!


## Who’s the ideal player archetype?

Using the in-game characters taxonomy according to the Bartle Taxonomy (see link), methinks the ideal player for this game is inherently an explorer. To this end we need to hide gratifying clues and easter-eggs for the players to find. 


## Defining the World
### Hospital

The whole gameplay happens in a multi-storey hospital building. Character should be able to move from room to room.
